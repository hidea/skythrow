SkyThrow supports sharing posts from the Android and iOS sharing menus to other apps.

投稿をAndroid、iOSの共有メニューから他のアプリへ共有できます。

{% include gallery id="share_ios_gallery" layout="third" caption="Share on iOS" %}

{% include gallery id="share_android_gallery" layout="third" caption="Share on Android" %}

We have confirmed that it is possible to share photos on SNS apps such as X and LINE Talk.  
It is also possible to share on mixi2, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, etc., but there are restrictions and it is not stable. There are cases where it is not possible to share posts that do not include photos, posts that include multiple photos, or posts that include text.

SNSアプリでは、𝕏、LINEトークへ写真付きで共有できました。  
mixi2、Facebook、Threads、Instagramなどへも共有できましたが制限もあり安定しません。写真を含まない投稿や複数枚の写真を含んだ投稿、逆にテキストを含む投稿の共有はうまくできない場合があります。

{% include gallery id="share1_gallery" layout="third" %}

The original post and X, sharing to LINE.

元となる投稿と𝕏、LINEへの共有。

{% include gallery id="share2_gallery" layout="third" %}

Share on instagram and Facebook.

instagram、Facebookへの共有。

{% include gallery id="setting_gallery" layout="third" %}

By default, SkyThrow will return you to the home screen after posting to Bluesky.
To change this, go to Settings and change the “Return to home after posting” setting to “Do not return” or “Confirm”.

SkyThrowの初期設定ではBlueskyへ投稿するとホーム画面に戻ってしまいます。
そのため投稿前に共有する必要がありますが、「設定」の「投稿後はホームに戻る」を「戻らない」「確認する」に変更することでBlueskyへ投稿した後に共有できるようになります。
